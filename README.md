# SIMON-GAME
The Simon game is classic  memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colored in the correct order. The game starts with a simple pattern, and with each successful round, the sequence becomes longer and more complex. Players must remember and replicate the pattern by pressing the corresponding colored buttons in the right order. 

# Instructions for Playing the Simon Game:

1. Start the Game: Turn on the Simon game. The game will begin by lighting up one of the colored buttons and playing a sound.


2. Observe the Sequence: Pay close attention to the color and sound of the button that lights up. This is the first part of the sequence.


3. Repeat the Sequence: After the light and sound show, it’s your turn. Press the corresponding button in the same order you saw and heard.


4. Build the Sequence: If you correctly repeat the sequence, Simon will add another color to the pattern. It will now be longer, and you'll need to remember and repeat the entire new sequence.


5. Keep Going: The game continues with each new round, adding another color and sound to the sequence. Your goal is to keep up without making any mistakes.


6. Game Over: If you make a mistake by pressing the wrong color, the game will end, and you’ll hear an error sound. The game will then show your score (the number of correct sequences you've completed).


7. Start Over: You can start a new game and try to beat your high score!
